## Dataset used

We used a fictional Ebola outbreak dataset, which has been published in [The EpiRhandbook](https://epirhandbook.com/en/download-handbook-and-data.html)

Our aim is to visualize the epidemiological trend of a finctional Ebola outbreak, and show which age group is most affected

## Data visualization

We created DatViz for three different audiences:

### Scientific figure for publication & to present at a conference

Weekly incidence of cases by age category, generated by R code

Weekly incidence of cases by hospital, generated by Python code

### Visualisation for lay audience (SciComm, Twitter, local newspaper)
